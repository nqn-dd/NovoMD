## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-08

### Added
- Comprehensive test suite with pytest (70%+ coverage target)
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
  - Automated testing on Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
  - Code linting (flake8, black, isort)
  - Type checking (mypy)
  - Security scanning (bandit, safety)
  - Docker build verification
- `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging
- `requirements-dev.txt` for development dependencies
- Rate limiting middleware (100 requests/minute default)
- Pre-commit hooks configuration

### Changed
- Improved CORS configuration with environment variable control
- API key comparison now uses timing-attack resistant comparison
- Updated `/status` endpoint to reflect actual implemented capabilities

### Fixed
- Documentation inconsistencies between SECURITY.md and CONTRIBUTING.md
- Removed references to unimplemented features in API responses

### Security
- Added `secrets.compare_digest()` for API key validation
- Configurable CORS origins (no longer allows all origins by default)
- Added rate limiting to prevent abuse
